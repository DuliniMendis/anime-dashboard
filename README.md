# AniRealm

This is a simple list and details pages app made with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 14.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository in you local environment. 
- You might need to change you node version to v20.16.0. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to keep multiple node versions and switch between them.
- Copy the `.example-env` file as `.env` and add the `AUTH_SECRET`.
- Copy the `.example-env.local` file as `.env.local` and add the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
- You can use any of the popular package managers to install dependencies and run the development server.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
or 
```
yarn install
yarn dev
```
or
```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```
or 
```
yarn test
```
or 
```
pnpm test
```

## The development process

I've been using NextJS 13 with the pages router and client-side pages in my current job so it was a learning experience to use server side rendering. It's not a fully polished production app but I tried to incorporate some additional features that were not in the design brief. They are outlined below.

### **GraphQL**

- I setup `graphql-codegen` to generate types with the co-location plugin to prevent types from the two queries I was using from conflicting with each other.
- Ideally I would also make a factory generator that generates mock data for each query so they can be used in testing.

### **Forms**

- The forms don't have error messages coming back from the server if the form action failed. If I had more time, I would've added those.

### **Modal and interception**

- I made the modal with anime details show up by using route interception. It could've been done in a simple modal but I thought I'd try the parallel route concept just to add some (maybe unnecessary) complexity.

### **Styles**

- I extended the theme in `Chakra UI` a bit and used some Google fonts.
- This was the first time I used `Chakra UI` but it was pretty easy to use.

### **Authentication**

- I used `next-auth` to block routes until users logged in using a middleware pattern.
- I also added a `Postgres` database that stores the user data. 
- 'Next-auth' was so confusing to setup but I think I got it working.
- When you log in, a session is created with the `userId` saved in the session. 
- A `UserContext` reads the `userId` from the session and fetches the full user from the DB using server actions. 
- When user details are edited, the `UserContext` is updated as well.
- The login and edit details forms show an error if you try to use a username that is already used with a jobTitle that doesn't match the existing username. Since this  is a made-up scenario and users won't be using usernames and job titles to log in, I thought it was fine to show this error. I wouldn't do this if passwords were involved since you can find passwords of other users with this security loophole.

### **Testing**

- I configured `jest` and `React Testing Library` and wrote a few unit tests. Obviously they are just examples and not comprehensive at all.
- There are no E2E tests but that would be something I'd have in a typical CI/CD pipeline.
- I would've used `faker-js` for mocking values for tests but I didn't do it in this app since it might be overkill.

### **Formatting**

- I added `Prettier` for making formatting consistent.
- I would've added an import sorting package as well if I had time.
